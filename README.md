Our JavaScript code will be used in a drawing tool, and we need classes to represent our geometric shapes. We will focus on creating rectangles and squares.

The rectangle will be constructed using two pieces of information (width and height). The square, on the other hand, will be constructed with only one dimension and will be an extension of the rectangle.
